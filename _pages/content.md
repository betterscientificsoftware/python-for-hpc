## Scientific Programming in Python

### Scientific Computing Packages:
 - [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
 - [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) A Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. Now incorporates: Numpy, the SciPy library, Matplotlib, IPython, SymPy and Pandas.
 - [(NEW) SymPy examples used for deriving equations](https://github.com/QMCPACK/qmc_algorithms){:target="_blank"} for code generation and testing by Mark Dewing.
### Speeding up Python

These packages all involve creating compiled code from Python. This can be done using packages such as [NumPy and SciPy](#scientific-programming-in-python). Alternatively, you can use tools to compile Python code. Some popular ones are given below.

 - [Cython](http://cython.org/) Create C code from modified Python. Enables performance and threading [Beginners video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfnMJMkhDoQ&list=PLhsR3m5MO5X6T4Bs_9h1azJoQ9srQmQAC)
 - [PyPy](https://pypy.org/) Implementation of the Python language that JIT compiles for performance. No code changes required.
 - [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) Numba is an open source JIT compiler that translates a subset of Python and NumPy code into fast machine code. Numba supports Intel and AMD x86, POWER8/9, and ARM CPUs, NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. Relies on decorators to identify code sections to accelerate. Requires LLVM for compiler, but works with the standard CPython.  [Accelerating Python with Numba (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYIPEDnp5C4) 
 - Note: A growing alternative to speeding up Python is the compiled language [Julia](https://julialang.org/)

### Create Python Bindings to Code:
 - [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/) – Generate bindings to C/C++. Works with Python and other high level languages.
 - [F2PY](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/f2py/index.html) – Create Python interfaces to Fortran (part of NumPy).
 - [PyBind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/master/) – “seamless operability between C++11 and Python”
 - [Boost.Python](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_68_0/libs/python/doc/html/index.html) – “seamless operability between C++ and Python”
 - [ctypes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html) – built-in Python FFI for interfacing C
 
 - Recommended reading: [Python modules in C](http://dan.iel.fm/posts/python-c-extensions)

### Python on Accelerators
 - [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) supports GPUS (see description above). [github](https://github.com/numba/numba)
 - [CuPy](https://cupy.chainer.org/) NumPy-like API accelerated with CUDA. "CuPy's interface is highly compatible with NumPy; in most cases it can be used as a drop-in replacement. All you need to do is just replace numpy with cupy in your Python code." [github](https://github.com/cupy/cupy)
 
 - [PyCUDA](https://documen.tician.de/pycuda/tutorial.html)
   PyCUDA lets you access Nvidia's CUDA parallel computation API from Python.
 - [PyOpenCL](https://documen.tician.de/pyopencl/index.html)
   PyOpenCL lets you access the OpenCL parallel computation API from Python


 
## Parallel and Distributed Programming:

### Shared Memory Parallelism
 
 Note: Python provides an in-built [threading](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html) module. However, this is not really suitable for parallel computation due to the [GIL](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock) (Global Interpreter Lock)
 
 - [Multiprocessing module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html) Basic multiple process parallelism through forked interpreters (with threading like interface). Be aware of issues mixing with OpenMP, MPI, or shared memory tools.
 

### Distributed Memory Parallelism

 - [mpi4py](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) Python wrapper for MPI
 - [PyCOMPSs](https://www.bsc.es/research-and-development/software-and-apps/software-list/comp-superscalar/) PyCOMPSs is a programming model that enables the parallelization of sequential Python codes following a task-based approach. PyCOMPSs enables the execution in distributed infrastructures, such as Clusters, Grids, Clouds, and containers.


## Scientific Libraries for HPC
